template.description: "(Pay-As-You-Go account required) With this toolchain, you can develop and deploy an application securely into Code Engine, a shared, multi-tenant Kubernetes service on IBM Cloud. By default, the toolchain uses a sample Node.js \"Hello World\" app, but you can link to your own GitHub repository instead. The toolchain is preconfigured for continuous delivery with [Vulnerability Advisor](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/va?topic=va-va_index), source control, issue tracking, and online editing.\n\n You can manage your Code Engine projects and applications in the [console](https://cloud.ibm.com/codeengine/projects).\n\nThe toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service. If an instance of that service isn't already in the selected resource group or organization, when you click **Create**, it is automatically added with the free [Lite](/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/) plan selected.\n\nTo get started, click **Create**.~otc-ui1194"
template.gettingStarted: " **Your toolchain is ready!**\n**Quick start:** Commit a change to the Git repo to trigger a new Docker image build, which is scanned for vulnerabilites and deployed in your Code Engine project. For step-by-step instructions, see the [tutorial](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tutorial-cd-code-engine) for this toolchain.~otc-ui1195"
